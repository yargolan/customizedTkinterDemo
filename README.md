## Tiny demo

### How to reproduce the issue

- Clone the repo
- create a venv and activate it
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `pytho3 my_demo.py`
- When the main frame appers, press the 'ADD' button
- Note that a new frame is created
- press the 'Back' button.
- **Expected**: The label and button from the 2nd frame are deleted and I am able to see the original frame.
- **Issue**: The 'back' button is not deleted.

#### Any assistance will be highly appreciated
